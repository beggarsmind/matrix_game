Memory Matrix: Icons of Computing is a memory game where you match pairs of cards featuring iconic tech symbols. Click on a card to reveal its symbol, then click a second card to find a match. If they match, they stay face-up. The game tracks your time, and a confetti animation celebrates your victory once all pairs are matched!
